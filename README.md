FinalFantasyGridWorld
=====================

This is a final project for AP Computer Science by Sean Mac Lane and Shonee Freed-Doerr

A text window will open up below the main gui, bring it into view in order to see in-game tutorials and alerts.

The gui is a modified version of grid world by The College Board.

The text based battles will only clear properly when the program is run in BlueJ.
